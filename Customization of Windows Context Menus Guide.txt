CONTEXT MENU CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE:
*Using registry edits. 

This guide describes how to edit and customize the context menus accessed by:

-right clicking on a FOLDER
-shift + right click on a FOLDER
-right clicking on the BACKGROUND OF a folder, or desktop
-shift + right click on the BACKGROUND Of a folder, or desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION

In the registry, there are 2 directories corresponding to the above referenced
menus.

For the BACKGROUND context menus, the registry directory that's changed to customize
these menus is:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Directory\background\shell

For the FOLDER context menus, the registry directory that's changed to
customize these menus is: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Directory\shell

The shift + right click versions of the FOLDER and BACKGROUND context menus are the 
"Extended" FOLDER and "Extended" BACKGROUND context menus. 

Each sub-directory in these two directories corresponds to an option
within their respective menus. The contents of these sub-directories determines
their attributes and functionality. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADDING AN OPTION TO A CONTEXT MENU FOR RIGHT CLICK AND SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK

To add an option to one of these context menus, right click on the respective directory 
for either FOLDER or BACKGROUND menus and click new>key. This will create a new 
subdirectory; it's name does not matter. 

Click on this new subdirectory and,
in the windows registry editor, on the right pane you will see a value
called "(Default)" of type "REG_SZ". Double click on this value to change it's
Data. The value's data will be the name of the option in the context menu.
After doing this, you should be able to access that context menu with just a
right click and see your option immediately - no need to refresh or close anything.

To give your option a command that is run when the option is selected, create
a new key (or subdirectory) in the option subdirectory you just made. Call
this new key "command". This name DOES matter. 

Go to the key you just made, called "command", and go to it's value called
"(Default)" on the right pane of windows registry editor. Double click the value
and change its data to the command you'd like to run. To test that it's working, you can put
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\notepad.exe". When you access that context menu and
select your option, it should open a new instance of notepad. 

-ADDING AN OPTION TO A CONTEXT MENU FOR ONLY SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK

To make an option show up only in the shift+right click version of a menu, follow 
the steps above for making an option, then right click on its key in that menu's 
subdirectory and add a string value called "Extended". No need to give it any data. 
It should then only be seen after shift+right click in the "Extended" context menu. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

REMOVING AN OPTION FROM A CONTEXT MENU

To remove an option from a context menu, you can simply remove it's key from
that menu's directory, but that solution is hard to undo if you ever want that
option back. A better solution is to simply disable it. This can be done by
adding a string value called "LegacyDisable" to that option's key. It then
won't show up in its context menu.

OTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS

-ADDING ICONS

To add an icon to an option, you can add a string value to that option's key
called "Icon". Change the data of the string value you just made to the full
path of an application (don't forget the file extension). The option will then
take on the icon of that application. This doesn't always work for all
applications, and may put a default icon in instead. You can get around this
by putting the path directly to a icon file (.ico) .
